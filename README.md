# Decoded Source

This is a collection of projects and tools developed by and for [DecodedSports.com](https://www.decodedsports.com) that we are releasing to open source.

DecodedSports heavily relies on many incredible open source projects, so the least we can do is give back in a small way. All the tools here, we've custom built in-house to tackle a specific challenge related to sports and data science in some way - with a few one off exceptions.

# Our Projects

### DORM

[D]ummy ORM is a Python SQLite database Object-relational Mapper (ORM) that implements the simplest, most lightweight, most naive possible ORM for quick and dirty data wrangling.

### MrElo

MrElo is like scikit-learn but for modeling ratings between competitors. It implements the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) created by [Mr. Arpad Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpad_Elo) in 1960.

Also, included are some non-Elo based rating algorithms.

Code coming Soon!

### OptiMight

OptiMight is a mighty Python optimizer that is a wrapper around [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for quickly throwing darts at a wall and seeing what sticks.

OptiMight takes a data set and brute forces every combination of the most common preprocessors paired to the most common Supervised and Unsupervised learning models tuned with their most common hyper-parmeters. All of this is done in an auto-configured pipeline using Grid Search with Cross-validation.

It can even be used to optimize MrElo!

Code Coming Soon!


### LimeLight-js

A JavaScript text search and highlight tool, with emphasis on the <b>highlighting</b> part. Good tools for this are surprisingly hard to come by and all have tricky edge case bugs. LimeLight has found it's day to shine, with far less edge case bugs.

Code coming Soon!
